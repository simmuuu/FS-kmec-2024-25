# Library Book Collection Manager

## Problem Description

You are managing a library's nested array of book collections. Each collection is an array containing book objects. Each book object includes the following properties:
- `title` (string): The title of the book.
- `borrowed` (boolean): A flag indicating whether the book is currently borrowed.

Your task is to perform the following operations:
- **Find the Collection:** Locate the collection containing a specific book title using `findIndex`.
- **Remove the Book:** Once the collection is identified, find the book within the collection using `findIndex` and remove it using `splice`.
- **Flatten the Library:** Combine all collections into a single-level array using the `flat` method.

### Expected Output
```javascript
Flattened Library: [
    { title: "The Great Gatsby", borrowed: false },
    { title: "Moby Dick", borrowed: true },
    { title: "Animal Farm", borrowed: false },
    { title: "To Kill a Mockingbird", borrowed: true },
    { title: "The Catcher in the Rye", borrowed: false }
]
```

## Solution

```javascript
const library = [
    [
        { title: "The Great Gatsby", borrowed: false },
        { title: "Moby Dick", borrowed: true }
    ],
    [
        { title: "1984", borrowed: false },
        { title: "Animal Farm", borrowed: false }
    ],
    [
        { title: "To Kill a Mockingbird", borrowed: true },
        { title: "The Catcher in the Rye", borrowed: false }
    ]
];

const bookToRemove = "1984";

// Flatten library
const flatLib = library.flat();

// Remove the book
const remInd = flatLib.findIndex((book) => book.title === bookToRemove);
if (remInd !== -1) {
    flatLib.splice(remInd, 1);
}

console.log(flatLib);
```
