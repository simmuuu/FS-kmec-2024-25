# Decision Tree Flipper

## Problem Description

VishnuVardan is working with Decision Trees for AI-based predictions. To analyze alternative outcomes, Kishore has planned to flip the decision tree horizontally to simulate a reverse processing approach.

### Rules for Flipping the Decision Tree:
- The original root node becomes the new rightmost node.
- The original left child becomes the new root node.
- The original right child becomes the new left child.

This transformation is applied level by level recursively.

### Input Format
- Space-separated integers, nodes of the tree.

### Output Format
- Print the list of nodes of the flipped tree.

### Sample Input-1
```
4 2 3 5 1
```

### Sample Output-1
```
5 1 2 3 4
```

### Sample Input-2
```
4 2 5
```

### Sample Output-2
```
2 5 4
```
