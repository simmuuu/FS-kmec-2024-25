[1135. Connecting Cities With Minimum Cost (leetcode.ca)](https://leetcode.ca/all/1135.html)

There are N cities numbered from 1 to N.

You are given `connections`, where each `connections[i] = [city1, city2, cost]` represents the cost to connect `city1` and `city2` together.  (A connection is bidirectional: connecting `city1` and `city2` is the same as connecting `city2` and `city1`.)

Return the minimum cost so that for every pair of cities, there exists a path of connections (possibly of length 1) that connects those two cities together.  The cost is the sum of the connection costs used. If the task is impossible, return -1.

**Example 1**:
```
Input: N = 3, connections = [[1,2,5],[1,3,6],[2,3,1]]
Output: 6
Explanation: 
Choosing any 2 edges will connect all cities so we choose the minimum 2.
```

**Example 2**:
```
Input: N = 4, connections = [[1,2,3],[3,4,4]]
Output: -1
Explanation: 
There is no way to connect all cities even if all edges are used.
