/*
Arjun wants to build a swimming pool, in the backyard of his farm-house.
The backyard has an empty land of size m*n. 
Some part of the backyard is used to build the swimming pool
You will be given the m*n grid values (0's and 1's). 
where 1 indicates swimming pool, and 0 indiactes empty land.

Your task to find the perimeter of the swimming pool.

Note: There is only one swimming pool.

Input Format:
-------------
Line-1: Two integers M and N, size of the backyard.
Next M lines: N space separated integers, either 0 or 1
0- represents empty land and 1- represents the swimming pool 

Output Format:
--------------
Print an integer, the perimeter of the swimming pool


Sample Input-1:
---------------	
4 4
0 1 0 0
1 1 1 0
0 1 0 0
1 1 0 0
 
Sample Output-1:
----------------
