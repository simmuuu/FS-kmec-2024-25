# WebSockets Group Chat

## Overview

### Real-Time Group Chat using WebSockets

This document outlines the steps to create a real-time group chat application using WebSockets. Multiple users (clients) will be able to join a chatroom and exchange messages in real-time. The application consists of a WebSocket server and a browser-based client. All messages sent by any client will be visible to all other connected clients, including the sender â€” similar to a WhatsApp group chat.



## Functional Requirements

### 1. WebSocket Server (Node.js)
You need to implement a WebSocket server with the following behavior:
- Accept connections from multiple clients.
- Maintain a list of all connected clients.
- When a message is received from any client, the server should broadcast that message to all connected clients.
- Handle client disconnections and remove disconnected clients from the active list.

### 2. Web-based Client (HTML + JavaScript)
You should create a basic client interface with the following requirements:
- Connect to the WebSocket server at `ws://localhost:8080`.
- The page should have:
    - A `<div>` with id `chat` that shows all chat messages.
    - An `<input>` box with id `msg` for typing the message.
    - A `<button>` that sends the message when clicked.
- When a message is received from the server:
    - It should be displayed as a new paragraph `<p>` inside the `#chat` area.
- When the user sends a message:
    - The message should be sent to the server using WebSocket.
    - The input box should be cleared after sending.



## Example URL:

- **Example URL:**  
  `http://192.168.xx.xx:5500/index.html`


## WebSocket Server Implementation (Node.js)

You will use the `ws` npm package to create the WebSocket server. Below is the implementation of the WebSocket server:

```javascript
const WebSocket = require('ws')
const server = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 55555 })

let socketConnections = []

server.on('connection', (ws) => {
    socketConnections.push(ws)  
    console.log(`Client Connected | ${socketConnections.length}`)

    ws.on('message', (data) => {
        const msg = data.toString()
        console.log(`Client Msg: ${msg}`)

        // Broadcast the message to all connected clients
        for (client of socketConnections) {
            if (client.readyState == WebSocket.OPEN) {
                client.send(msg)
            }
        }
    })

    ws.on('close', () => {
        // Remove client from the active list when disconnected
        socketConnections = socketConnections.filter((s) => s != ws)
        console.log(`Client Disconnected | ${socketConnections.length}`)
    })
})

console.log("Socket open at ws://localhost:55555")
```

### Explanation of Server Code:
- **WebSocket.Server**: The server listens for connections on port 55555.
- **socketConnections**: An array is used to maintain the list of connected clients.
- **'connection' event**: Each time a client connects, it is added to the `socketConnections` list.
- **'message' event**: When a client sends a message, it is broadcast to all other connected clients.
- **'close' event**: When a client disconnects, it is removed from the list of active connections.


## Web Client Implementation (HTML + JavaScript)

The client-side implementation will be a simple HTML page with an input box, a button, and a chat area. It uses JavaScript to handle WebSocket connections and message exchanges.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Real-Time Group Chat</title>
</head>
<body>
    <div id="chat"></div>
    <input id="msg" type="text">
    <button onclick="sendMessage()">Send</button>

    <script>
        // Connect to the WebSocket server
        const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:55555');
        
        // Function to handle incoming messages
        ws.onmessage = function(event) {
            const chat = document.getElementById('chat');
            const p = document.createElement('p');
            p.textContent = event.data;
            chat.appendChild(p);
        };

        // Function to send messages
        function sendMessage() {
            const msg = document.getElementById('msg').value;
            ws.send(msg);  // Send the message to the server
            document.getElementById('msg').value = '';  // Clear the input box
        }
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

### Explanation of Client Code:
- **WebSocket connection**: The client establishes a WebSocket connection to the server at `ws://localhost:55555`.
- **Handling incoming messages**: When a message is received from the server, it is displayed in the `#chat` div as a new paragraph.
- **Sending messages**: When the user clicks the "Send" button, the message is sent to the server, and the input field is cleared.



## How to Run:

1. **Install Node.js**: Make sure Node.js is installed on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).
   
2. **Install dependencies**: Use the following command to install the `ws` package:
   ```bash
   npm install ws
   ```

3. **Start the WebSocket server**:
   Save the server code in a file, for example, `server.js`, and then run the server:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

4. **Open the Web Client**:
   - Create a file named `index.html` with the client code.
   - Open the HTML file in a browser (either by double-clicking the file or using a local server if necessary).
   - Open multiple browser windows/tabs to simulate multiple clients.



## Expected Behavior:

- When a user sends a message, all connected clients (including the sender) will see the message in the `#chat` area.
- Messages will be broadcasted to all active clients in real-time.
- When a client disconnects, they are removed from the list of active connections.



## Example URL:

- **Local Web Client**:  
  `http://localhost:5500/index.html` (or the path where the client HTML is served)

# Mongo WebSockets

## Employee Management WebSocket Application with MongoDB

### Objective:
You are required to develop a WebSocket-based Employee Management System using Node.js and MongoDB. The system should allow multiple clients to interact with a database and perform the following operations:

1. **Insert Employee Records** (`INSERT <name> <salary> <role> <department> <experience>`)
2. **Retrieve Employee List** (`RETRIEVE`)
3. **Retrieve Employee List by Department** (`RETRIEVE_BY_DEPT <department>`)

The WebSocket server should handle multiple concurrent clients and persist employee data in MongoDB.

### MongoDB Employee Schema:
```javascript
const employeeSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    name: String,
    salary: Number,
    role: String,
    department: String,
    experience: Number
});
```

## Requirements

### WebSocket Server
The server should:
- Accept multiple client connections and respond with "Connected".
- Process incoming commands from clients as described above.
- Log each received command to the console.
- Ensure proper error handling (e.g., invalid salary, missing name, etc.).

### Expected Behavior

| **Client Command**               | **Server Response**                                                             |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `INSERT Alice 50000 Developer IT 5` | `"Employee inserted successfully."`                                             |
| `INSERT Bob 60000 Manager IT 5`    | `"Employee inserted successfully."`                                             |
| `RETRIEVE`                        | `"ID: 1, Name: Alice, Salary: 50000, Role: Developer, Department: IT, Experience: 5 years"` |
|                                  | `"ID: 2, Name: Bob, Salary: 60000, Role: Manager, Department: IT, Experience: 5 years"` |
| `RETRIEVE_BY_DEPT IT`             | `"ID: 1, Name: Alice, Salary: 50000, Role: Developer, Department: IT, Experience: 5 years"` |
|                                  | `"ID: 2, Name: Bob, Salary: 60000, Role: Manager, Department: IT, Experience: 5 years"` |
| `INVALID`                         | `"Invalid command."`                                                            |

## Notes:
- **MongoDB** should be used for data persistence.
- The WebSocket server should run on **port 8080**.
- The system should allow multiple clients to connect.

---

### Example URL:
`ws://10.11.xx.xx:8080`



## WebSocket Server Implementation with MongoDB

Below is the implementation of the WebSocket server that integrates with MongoDB:

```javascript
const ws = require("ws");
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

// Connect to MongoDB
mongoose.connect('mongodb://username:password@localhost:27017/employeeDB?authSource=admin')
.then(() => console.log("Connected to MongoDB"))
.catch(() => console.log("MongoDB connection failed"));

const employeeSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    id: Number,
    name: String,
    salary: Number,
    role: String,
    department: String,
    experience: Number
});

const Employee = mongoose.model("employee", employeeSchema);

// WebSocket Server
const server = new ws.Server({ port: 8080 });

async function handler(msg) {
    const data = msg.toString().split(" ");

    if (data[0] == "INSERT") {
        // Validate salary
        if (!Number.isInteger(parseInt(data[2]))) {
            return "Invalid salary";
        }

        const allEmp = await Employee.find({}, { _id: 0, __v: 0 });

        const emp = new Employee({
            id: allEmp.length + 1,
            name: data[1],
            salary: parseInt(data[2]),
            role: data[3],
            department: data[4],
            experience: parseInt(data[5])
        });

        await emp.save();

        return "Employee inserted successfully.";
    } else if (data[0] == "RETRIEVE") {
        let reply = "";
        const employees = await Employee.find({}, { _id: 0, __v: 0 });
        employees.forEach(u => {
            reply += `ID: ${u.id}, Name: ${u.name}, Salary: ${u.salary}, Role: ${u.role}, Department: ${u.department}, Experience: ${u.experience} years\n`;
        });
        return reply;
    } else if (data[0] == "RETRIEVE_BY_DEPT") {
        const department = data[1];

        let reply = "";
        const emp = await Employee.find({ department }, { _id: 0, __v: 0 });
        emp.forEach(u => {
            reply += `ID: ${u.id}, Name: ${u.name}, Salary: ${u.salary}, Role: ${u.role}, Department: ${u.department}, Experience: ${u.experience} years\n`;
        });

        return reply;
    } else {
        return "Invalid command.";
    }
}

// WebSocket Connection Handler
server.on("connection", (socket) => {
    console.log("Client connected!");

    socket.on("message", async (msg) => {
        socket.send(await handler(msg));
    });

    socket.on("close", () => {
        console.log("Client disconnected.");
    });
});

console.log("WebSocket server running at ws://localhost:8080");
```


### Explanation of the Server Code:
1. **MongoDB Connection**: 
   - Using the `mongoose` package to connect to a MongoDB database called `employeeDB`. The `employeeDB` stores employee records.
   
2. **Employee Schema**:
   - The schema defines the fields such as `id`, `name`, `salary`, `role`, `department`, and `experience` for each employee.

3. **WebSocket Server**:
   - The server listens for connections on port `8080`.
   - It handles three types of commands from the client:
     - `INSERT`: Adds a new employee to the database.
     - `RETRIEVE`: Retrieves all employees from the database.
     - `RETRIEVE_BY_DEPT`: Retrieves employees by department.

4. **Message Handling**:
   - When a message is received from a client, it is processed using the `handler` function. The function performs the necessary database operations and returns the appropriate response.
   
5. **Connection Management**:
   - The server maintains active WebSocket connections and handles client disconnections.


## How to Run:

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure Node.js is installed, and then run:
   ```bash
   npm install ws mongoose
   ```

2. **Run the WebSocket Server**:
   Save the server code in a file (e.g., `server.js`) and start it with:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

3. **Test the Application**:
   - Connect clients to `ws://localhost:8080` and test the functionality by sending commands (`INSERT`, `RETRIEVE`, `RETRIEVE_BY_DEPT`, etc.).
   - Ensure that the MongoDB instance is running and accessible.
