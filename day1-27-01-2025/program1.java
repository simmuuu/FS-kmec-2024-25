/*
You are given an integer array nums and two integers l and r. Your task is to 
find the minimum positive energy produced by a sequence of operations. 
Each operation corresponds to selecting a contiguous subarray of nums 
whose length is between l and r (inclusive).

The energy of a sequence is defined as the product of all the numbers in 
the subarray. You need to find the sequence with the smallest positive energy.

If no such sequence exists, return -1.

Input Format:
---------------
Line-1: Three space separated integers, N, L and R.
Line-2: N space separated integers, array[].

Output Format:
-----------------
An integer result, smallest positive energy.

Sample Input-1:
-----------------
4 2 3
2 -1 3 4

Sample Output-1:
-------------------
12

Explanation:
--------------
The possible sequences of operations with lengths between l = 2 and r = 3 are:

[2, -1] (not valid, energy = -2)
[3, 4] (energy = 12)
[2, -1, 3] (not valid, energy = -6)
The sequence [3, 4] produces the smallest positive energy of 12. Hence, 
the output is 12.

Sample Input-2:
-----------------
3 2 3
-1 -3 2

Sample Output-1:
-------------------
-1

Explanation:
No valid sequence produces a positive energy. Thus, the output is -1.

Constraints:
============
1 ≤ nums.length ≤ 100
1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ nums.length
−1000 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 1000
