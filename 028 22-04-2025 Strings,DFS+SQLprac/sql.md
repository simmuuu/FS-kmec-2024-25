### **Schema:**

```sql
/*
Database : univ
---------------

employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    department VARCHAR(50),
    salary INT,
    hire_date DATE
);

projects (
    project_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    project_name VARCHAR(100),
    department VARCHAR(50)
);

employee_projects (
    employee_id INT,
    project_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (employee_id) REFERENCES employees(employee_id),

*/

use univ;
select name, department, salary, RANK() over (Partition by department order by salary desc) as dept_rank 
from employees;
```

#### Sample Output:

| name    | department  | salary | dept\_rank |
| ------- | ----------- | ------ | ---------- |

from employees;
```

#### Sample Output:

| name    | department  | hire\_date | seniority\_rank |
| ------- | ----------- | ---------- | --------------- |
